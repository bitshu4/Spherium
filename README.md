# Spherium for Slope Plus
Welcome to **Spherium**, a mod that adds a skin system to Slope Plus. **Spherium** was originally meant to add a full-on gacha system to Slope Plus, but I reconsidered because people would be way too lazy to unlock skins. So, this is just a mod that adds some pre-made skins to the game, to which you can add your own by just adding your own image files to to the `SpheriumAssets` folder!

## Installation
Installing **Spherium** is very easy.
First, install [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader) and select Slope Plus as the target game while running the installer.
Then, simply drag all the folders of this project into your Slope Plus directory and the mod should work!

## Compatibility
This mod works when using Slope Plus version 1.3.1. Install the game [here](https://coweggs.itch.io/slope-plus).
