# Spherium for Slope Plus
Welcome to **Spherium**, a mod that adds a skin and trail system to Slope Plus. **Spherium** was originally meant to add a full-on gacha system to Slope Plus, but I reconsidered because people would be way too lazy to unlock skins. So, this is just a mod that adds some pre-made skins and customizable trails to the game, to which you can add your own skins by just adding your own image files to to the `SpheriumAssets` folder!

## Installation
Installing **Spherium** is very easy.
First, install [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader) and select Slope Plus as the target game while running the installer.
Then, simply download the .dll from the newest Release and put it in your `Mods` folder! If you open Slope Plus, it will download the skins and do the rest of the work for you!

## Compatibility
This mod works when using Slope Plus version 1.3.1. Install the game [here](https://coweggs.itch.io/slope-plus).
